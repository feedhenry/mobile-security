= Authentication & Session Management

|===
|Do's |Dont's

|*Perform Authentication on the Server Side.* _(The client side should never be trusted)_.
|*Use the Fingerprint Scanner solely for Authentication.* _(Possible False Positives [1])_.

|*Use Randomly Generated access tokens instead of sending user credentials in requests.* _(At worst, a temporary session token can therefore only be stolen)_.
|*Use Pattern Locks for Authentication.* _(Lack of Entropy, Vulnerable to Smudge Attacks [2])_.

|*A password policy is enforced at the remote endpoint.* _(Prevent easily guessable passwords from being used)_.
|*Use a short Pin code solely authentication.* _(Easily brute forced and the end user may reuse the device security pin)_.

|*Sessions are terminated at the remote endpoint after a predefined time.* _(Sessions token lifetimes should be kept short to limit the attack window if an valid session token is stolen)_.
|*Do not use any values for authenticating a user like device identifiers or geo-location.* _(These can be spoofed easily)_.

|*Temporarily lock out a user after a number of failed login attempts.* _(Prevent an endless brute force attack)_.
|*Avoid relying on any roles or permission information that comes from the mobile device itself.* _(The client side and user input should not be trusted)_.

|*Use contextual anomaly based detection to take into account the users IP, geographic location, time of day as part of the authentication phase.* _(Helps detect unusual login activity)_.
|*Log user related information.* _(Personal information data leak)_

|*A second factor of authentication exists and is enforced.* _(Extra layer of protection in case another authentication factor has been compromised)_.
|*Use OAuth1.0*. _(OAuth1.0 has been found to be vulnerable to session fixation. Use OAuth 1.0a or OAuth 2.0 instead)_.

|*Step-up authentication is used for carrying out sensitive actions in an application.* _(Useful when a user's device is stolen and they have already authenticated through the app)_.
|

|*Allow the user to see their current login sessions and allow them to logout of other sessions via the app.* _(The end user will be able to detect rogue sessions with the most accuracy instead of using anomaly detection)_.
|

|*Perform local integrity checks within the code to detect any unauthorized code changes before doing offline authentication.* _(Tampering may allow authentication bypasses)_.
|

|*Where offline access to data is needed, perform an account/application lockout and/or application data wipe after X number of invalid password attempts.* _(Wipe application data when a threat is imminent)_.
|

|*Perform a check at the start of each activity/screen to see if the user is in a logged in state and if not, switch to the login state.* _(A session could expire during use or over time. Also check that the user has a role that allows them to access to certain app view)._
|

|*When an applicationâ€™s session is timed out, the application should discard and clear all memory associated with the user data, and any master keys used to decrypt the data.* _(Prevent data leakage after the user is no longer in an active session with the server)._
|

|*Store a masked user identifier instead of the actual username, and replace the user identifier value in authentication with a hash value.* _(If a username/id is being used in the mobile app for identification purposes only (not for display in the UI), then consider sending a related mapped token to the mobile device instead.)_.
|

|*Implement Secure Password Recovery Mechanism*. _(To allow a user to recover their account using security questions only they should know the answers too and sending a recovery code using a side channel such as SMS)_.
|

|*Fail authentication with a Generic Error.* _(The login screen should not show hints on the existence of a username/email address etc)_.

An Authentication & Session Management implementation has been provided in our https://github.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template[Mobile Security Android Template] App.

The Application uses http://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] for authentication and access control. The Open Source Identity and Access Management server, http://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak], is being used as an Identity Provider.
The https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/auth.adoc[Aerogear Auth SDK] is being used for communicating with the Keycloak server.

The Keycloak server is enforcing a number of Security Controls on the mobile app.

=== Code Examples
The main code logic is found under https://github.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/aerogear/androidshowcase/features/authentication[mobile-security-android-template/.../authentication].

The following code snippets describe the main authentication code logic in the mobile app.

==== Configuration
The Keycloak configuration is saved in the https://github.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template/tree/master/app/src/main/assets/mobile-services.json[mobile-services.json] file.

.Code
[source,json,linenums,indent=0]
....
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template/master/app/src/main/assets/mobile-services.json[]
....

The redirect url of the application is defined in `android.defaultConfig.manifestPlaceholders` of the apps https://github.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template/blob/master/app/build.gradle[build.gradle] file.

You will also need to define the URL in the https://github.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/aerogear/androidshowcase/di/SecureApplicationModule.java[SecureApplicationModule].

.Code
[source,java,linenums,indent=0]
....
include::{partialsdir}/authServiceInit.inc.adoc[]
....

==== Authentication
We can then perform the auth request and create a new intent which will handle the auth response from the system browser. The authentication phase will occur in a system browser in a safe context outside of the application.

.Code
[source,java,linenums,indent=0]
....
include::{partialsdir}/login.inc.adoc[]
....

==== Handling the Authentication Response
Once the Authentication phase has ended, the user will be redirected back to the mobile app from the system browser.
A check is performed in the MainActivity for incoming intents so the result can be handled by the authentication service.

.Code
[source,java,linenums,indent=0]
....
include::{partialsdir}/onActivityResult.inc.adoc[]
....

==== Logout

To logout of the application, we must make a call to the logout endpoint on the OpenID Connect provider along with providing the identity token and a redirect URI.

.Code
[source,java,linenums,indent=0]
....
include::{partialsdir}/logout.inc.adoc[]

The `startAuth()` function handles the user authentication browser flow and the back-channel token exchange.

.Code
[source,swift,linenum,indent=0]
....
include::{partialsdir}/ioslogin.inc.adoc[]

....

The `resolveCurrentUser()` returns the user profile, which can be used to retrieve user information and the auth tokens.

.Code
[source,swift,linenum,indent=0]
....
include::{partialsdir}/resolveCurrentUser.inc.adoc[]
....

The following information can be retrieved from an authenticated user:

.Code
[source,swift,linenum,indent=0]
....
// Get the users username
let username = currentUser.userName
// Get the users first name
let firstName = currentUser.firstName
// Get the users last name
let lastName = currentUser.lastName
// Get the users full name
let fullName = currentUser.fullName
// Get the users email address
let emailAddress = currentUser.email
// Get the users access token
let accessToken = currentUser.accessToken
// Get the users identity token
let identityToken = currentUser.identityToken
....

Access Control is carried out by checking the access roles of the authenticated user.

.Code
[source,swift,linenum,indent=0]
....
include::{partialsdir}/highlightUserRealmRoles.inc.adoc[]
....

The `logout()` function is used to logout the user from the Keycloak server. The local auth tokens are also deleted.
