= OWASP Threat Model Project

This is a summary of notes taken from the https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Project#tab=M-Threat_Model_Project[OWASP Threat Model Project].

== Mobile Threat Model Overview
To carry out threat modelling, you will need to have a clear understanding of the underlying system. Its important to define the following areas to understand possible threat to the mobile application.

. **Mobile App Architecture** - This area describes how the application is designed from device specific features used by the application, such as:
* Wireless transmission protocols
* Data transmission mediums
* Interaction with hardware components
* Other applications

. **Mobile Data** - This area cover what data does the application store and process, the business purpose of this data and what are the data workflows.

. **Threat Agent Identification** - This area covers the threats to the mobile application and who are the threat agents.

. **Methods of Attack** - This area covers the most common attacks utilized by threat agents.

. **Controls** - This area covers the controls that can be used to prevent attacks.

== Mobile Architecture
The mobile application architecture should, at the very least, describe device specific features used by the application such as:

* Wireless transmission protocols
* Data transmission medium
* Interaction with hardware components and other applications.

Once you know what features/resources are used within the mobile app architecture, you can then begin to look at the attack surface.

Although mobile applications vary in function, they can be described using a generalized model as follows:

. Wireless interfaces
. Transmission Type
. Hardware Interaction
. Interaction with on device applications/services
. Interaction with off device applications/services
. Encryption Protocols

== Mobile Data
Its important to know what purpose does the app serve from a business perspective and what data the app stores, transmits and receives.
Itâ€™s also important to review data flow diagrams to determine exactly how data in the mobile app is handled.

You should aim to answer the following questions:

* What is the business functions of the app?
* Does personal data intermingle with corporate data?
* Is there specific business logic built into the app to process data?
* What does the data give you (or an attacker) access to?
* Do stored keys allow you to break crypto functions (data integrity)?
* Third party data, is it being stored/transmitted?
* Are there regulatory requirements to meet specific to user privacy?
* How does other data on the device affect the app (sandboxing restrictions enforced?)
* What is the impact of Jailbroken/Rooted vs Non Jailbroken/Rooted device and how this affects app data?

== Threat Agent Identification
This area covers what the threats to the mobile application are and who are the threat agents.

=== Identifying Threat Agents
The process of identifying a threat agent is very simple and have been mentioned in the below steps:

* S1: Take the list of all sensitive data

* S2: Make a list of all the ways to access this data

* S3: The medium used to access the same listed in S2 above is the Threat Agent to be identified

=== Listing of Threat Agents - By Category
==== Human Interaction Examples
* Stolen Device User
* Owner of the Device
* WiFi Network User
* Malicious Developer
* Organizations Internal Employee
* App Store Approvers/Reviewers

==== Automated Programs Examples
* Malware on the device
* Scripts executing in the browser
* Malicious SMS
* Malicious App

=== Methods of Attack
We should observe and list the different methods an attacker can use to reach the data.

=== Controls
Given the above methods of attacks, we should outline some controls to:

. Prevent the attacks
. Detect the attacks
. Minimize the impact of the attacks
. Protect users private information
