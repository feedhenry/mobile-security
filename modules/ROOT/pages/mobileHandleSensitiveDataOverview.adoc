= Handling Sensitive Data Overview

|===
| Do's | Dont's
| *Sensitive data should stay in RAM for as little time as possible* _(Prevent data leak)_
| *Send sensitive data over alternate channels (e.g, SMS, MMS, or notifications)* _(They are not encrypted)_

| *Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) should be taken advantage of* _(Limit the impact of attacks such as buffer overflow)_
| *Encryption keys remain in RAM during the instance lifecycle of the app.* _(Prevent the key from being read from memory)_

| *minimize the use of APIs that access sensitive or personal user data* _(Prevent data leak)_
| *Write data to log files* _(Other applications can access the log data)_

| *Consider using a hash or non-reversible form of the data* _(To protect the original data)_
| *Store/cache sensitive data on the device* _(It can be leaked)_

| *minimize the frequency of asking for user credentials. Instead use an authorization token and refresh it* _(Less chance of exposing user credentials)_
| *storing/logging GPS data* _(Protect user privacy)_

| *Use secure POST to send user data, with XSRF token protection* _(Query params in URL are logged)_
| *Sending crash logs over the network in plaintext* _(Can contain sensitive info)_

| *Add an additional layer of verified, third-party encryption (e.g., SQLCipher) to the data as device encryption is not sufficient* _(Extra layer of protection)_
