= Cryptography Summary

|===
| Do's | Dont's

| Apply cryptographic standards that will withstand the test of time for at least 10 years into the future
| Including the keys in the same attacker-readable directory as the encrypted content

| Use http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm[NIST FIPS-validated] crypto modules
| Use of hardcoded keys within the binary

| Use NIST approved or NSA approved key management technology and processes
| Creation and Use of Custom Encryption Protocols

| Recommended minimal key lengths and algorithms 

Key exchange : Diffieâ€“Hellman with a minimum of 2048 bits

Message Integrity: HMAC-SHA2 (or HMAC-SHA-256)

Message Hash: SHA2 256 bits

Asymetric encryption: RSA 2048 bits

Symmetric-key algorithm: AES 128 bits (CBC or GCM)

Password Hashing: PBKDF2, Scrypt, Bcrypt
| Use of Insecure and/or Deprecated Algorithms, like RC2, MD5, MD4, SHA1 

|
| Use the same cryptographic key for multiple purposes

|
| Random values are generated using a sufficiently secure random number generator
