= OWASP Mobile Verification Standard

This is a fork of the https://www.owasp.org/images/f/fe/MASVS_v0.9.3.pdf[OWASP Mobile Verification Standard].

== Verification Levels

* MASVS-L1: Standard Security
** lists security best practices
** all mobile apps
* MASVS-L2: Defense-in-Depth
** introduces advanced security controls
** should be used by apps that store personally identifiable information, or highly sensitive information, like apps for health-care industry and financial industry
* MASVS-R: Resiliency Against Reverse Engineering and Tampering
** the app has state-of-the-art security, and is also resilient against specific client side attacks, such as tampering, modding or reverse engineering
** can be used in combination with the other 2 levels. E.g. MASVS-L1 + R or MASVS-L2 + R

== Table Keys

_Category_ - The type of work required for each item. Some enhancements have been made.

* Manual Observation - A task that may only require manual observation. eg. confirming that no sensitive information is being stored in log files.
* Tooling - A task that may require the use of tooling to carry out the task. eg. pentesting or creating threat models
* Process - A task that may require some processes to be setup. eg. dependency checks.
* Coding - A task that requires coding.
* Keycloak - A task that can be carried out using Keycloak.

_OS/Framework Columns_ - A column is allocated for each Mobile OS/Framework for any specific details for each item.
