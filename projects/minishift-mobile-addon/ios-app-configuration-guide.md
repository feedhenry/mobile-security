# Configure and Build the iOS Template App

1. Clone the [iOS mobile security template](https://github.com/feedhenry/mobile-security-ios-template)
2. Follow the instructions in the README file of the repo and make necessary changes to make sure the app will work with services that are running on Minishift.
3. Since the services running on Minishift will use self-signed certificates, you also need to follow the instructions in the README file to support it.
4. You can now build and install the app onto devices using Xcode.
